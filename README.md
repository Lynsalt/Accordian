# Accordian -
This project was actually a test given to me on a fontend interview at a company which I applied. 
The idea here is to build an accordian and use vanilla javascript to toggle the hidden information.
when the div is closed a plus icon "+" should dislay. When the div is open a minus icon "-" must display.
